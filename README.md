# Spread of Disease Simulator (MATLAB)  
## A Martian Epidemiology Study Inspired by H.G. Wells

This project implements a simplified **agent-based disease spread model** in MATLAB. But here's the twist: it's framed as a fictional epidemiological study on **Martians**, inspired by H.G. Wells' *The War of the Worlds*.

It simulates how an unknown Earth-borne pathogen spreads through a closed Martian population over time. This makes it both a technically sound model of stochastic disease dynamics and a creative educational tool for exploring epidemic behavior in novel contexts.

## Overview

Each Martian is classified daily as:
- **NI**: Infected (in incubation)
- **NC**: Contagious (actively spreading)
- **NHI**: Healthy but Immune (recovered)
- **NH**: Healthy with No Immunity (vulnerable)

These states evolve based on random interactions, incubation durations, contagious periods, and immunity windows. Immunity fades with time, allowing reinfectionâ€”echoing themes of vulnerability and decay central to H.G. Wells' original narrative.

## Features

- Stochastic simulation using individual agent tracking
- Variable-length incubation, contagiousness, and immunity
- Immunity decay and reinfection possible
- Multiple simulation runs to visualize variability
- Visualizations and tables showing disease progression over time
